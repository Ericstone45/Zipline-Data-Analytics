Potential Problems at Zipline and How Data Analytics Can Help:
1.	Drone Flight Reliability and Safety:
o	Problem: Drones may experience issues such as flight malfunctions, battery failure, navigation errors, or crashes during delivery.
o	Data Analytics Solution:
	Monitor and analyze flight data (e.g., speed, altitude, battery levels, GPS location) to predict and prevent potential failures.
	Create dashboards to visualize flight health metrics.
	Set up alerts for critical flight parameters, enabling immediate action to prevent accidents.
	Analyze trends in drone performance to improve flight safety protocols.
2.	Maintenance Scheduling:
o	Problem: Drones require regular maintenance, and if maintenance isn't done on time, it can lead to unexpected failures and operational delays.
o	Data Analytics Solution:
	Implement predictive analytics to forecast when drones will require maintenance based on historical data (e.g., total flight hours, component wear).
	Set up automated reminders or dashboards that indicate when drones need maintenance, reducing the chance of failure during deliveries.
3.	Delivery Time Optimization:
o	Problem: Delays in deliveries can impact the timely arrival of medical supplies.
o	Data Analytics Solution:
	Analyze delivery route data and weather patterns to optimize delivery times.
	Build a real-time dashboard to track delivery progress and identify bottlenecks in the delivery process.
	Use data analytics to optimize flight paths and reduce delivery times.
4.	Real-Time Fleet Monitoring:
o	Problem: There can be challenges in managing the fleet of drones, ensuring that all drones are in the right location and ready for delivery.
o	Data Analytics Solution:
	Set up a real-time fleet management system to track drone location, health status, and readiness.
	Use data visualization to monitor fleet operations across all delivery zones.
	Build alerts and notifications when a drone is nearing a failure point or deviates from its assigned task.
5.	Weather-Related Disruptions:
o	Problem: Weather conditions can significantly affect drone flight safety and delivery times.
o	Data Analytics Solution:
	Analyze weather patterns and historical flight data to predict the likelihood of weather disruptions.
	Implement weather data integration into flight planning systems to reschedule deliveries or avoid dangerous weather conditions.
6.	Customer Delivery Feedback:
o	Problem: Customer satisfaction is critical, and feedback regarding delivery issues (e.g., delays, incorrect deliveries) may not always be captured effectively.
o	Data Analytics Solution:
	Gather customer feedback data and delivery quality metrics to assess customer satisfaction.
	Use sentiment analysis on customer feedback to identify patterns in customer dissatisfaction.
	Create a dashboard to track customer complaints and provide insights into the root causes of delivery issues.

Project Overview:
The project will focus on a Data Analytics System for monitoring Zipline’s operations, especially targeting drone performance, delivery times, fleet management, and maintenance scheduling. Here's an outline of the system:
1.	Key Objectives:
o	Monitor drone flight reliability (health metrics, battery status, GPS data).
o	Optimize maintenance scheduling based on predictive analytics.
o	Improve delivery times by analyzing and optimizing routes.
o	Track real-time fleet status and prevent delivery failures.
o	Monitor weather disruptions and reschedule deliveries if needed.
o	Analyze customer feedback for service improvement.
2.	Key Components:
o	Data Collection: Collect data from drones, weather sensors, customer feedback forms, and operational logs.
o	Data Storage: Store data in a cloud database (Snowflake or similar).
o	Data Processing and Analysis: Use tools like Power BI, Python, or R to analyze and process the data.
o	Dashboards and Alerts: Build real-time dashboards using Power BI or Grafana to display key performance indicators (KPIs) and set up alerts based on thresholds.
3.	Technology Stack:
o	Data Storage: Snowflake (or another cloud database).
o	Data Analytics Tools: Python (for data processing and modeling), Power BI (for visualization), Grafana (for real-time monitoring).
o	Data Collection: API Integration with drones, weather sensors, and other IoT devices.
o	Data Pipeline: Use ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools to streamline data collection and processing.
    




Steps to Build the Project:
Step 1: Define the Database Schema
•	Tables: Create tables for storing flight data, maintenance logs, weather data, customer feedback, etc.
o	drones
o	flights
o	maintenance
o	deliveries
o	weather
o	customer_feedback
•	Define the relationships between the tables.
Step 2: Data Collection and Integration
•	Integrate data sources like drone telemetry, weather APIs, and customer feedback into the system.
•	Use Python to automate data collection from these sources and store them in the Snowflake database.
Step 3: Data Analysis and Modeling
•	Perform predictive analysis on drone health and maintenance schedules.
•	Analyze delivery times and weather conditions to identify patterns and suggest improvements.
Step 4: Build Dashboards
•	Use Power BI or Grafana to create real-time dashboards that display:
o	Drone health metrics.
o	Delivery performance (on-time vs. delayed deliveries).
o	Fleet status (active, idle, in maintenance).
o	Customer feedback trends.
o	Weather disruptions and affected flights.
Step 5: Set Up Alerts
•	Configure alerting mechanisms in Power BI or Grafana to notify the team when a drone is nearing a failure point, when weather disruptions are predicted, or when customer complaints spike.
Step 6: Testing and Deployment
•	Test the system using historical data and simulate real-time scenarios.
•	Deploy the solution on cloud platforms to handle large-scale data.
